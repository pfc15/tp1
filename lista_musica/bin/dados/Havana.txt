Hey

Havana, ooh na na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, oh na na na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na na

He didn't walk up with that: How you doin'?
(When he came in the room)
He said thereâ€™s a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh
I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh
And then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na na na na na

Havana, ooh na na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, oh na na na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na na

Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam (jam)
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ayy)

Get to diggin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin' on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that be
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
